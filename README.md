## Installation

Just download/fork/clone and launch index.html in a browser with or without HTTP server.

## Why?

I found [Backbone Boilerplate](http://backboneboilerplate.com/) too complicated and too big for the boilerplate. 

## To do

* Add Twitter Bootstrap
* Add models and collections 
* Add extra page with examples
